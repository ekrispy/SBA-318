# SBA-318

welcome to my Restfull API
here you can navigate throught the urls posted on localhost:3000/

on the users route a page will be rendered and you can make a post request by adding in a users info

the meals and commments route allows you to see that data, or you can filter it by the id paramater. 

very basic css for the view page

some custom middleware is included on the index page to get  TIME STAMP AND ALSO A LOG STAMP

For the bonuses
I used EJS so that should work, 
and I added a regualar expression to the Users route to add anything between us and ers, ( it will still take you to the route)
